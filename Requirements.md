## Project Name: Library Management System
### Description:  Build a backend API for managing a libraryâ€™s book inventory. 
* The system should handle standard book management and also process notifications for users when a
wishlisted book is returned.
### Requirements
* #### CRUD Operations for Books:
  * Create: Add a new book with fields like title, author, isbn,
publishedYear, and availabilityStatus.
  * Read: Retrieve a paginated list of books with optional filters (e.g., by author,
publishedYear).
  * Update: Edit book details. A key use case is updating
availabilityStatus when a book is borrowed or returned.
  * Delete: Remove a book from the inventory.
* #### Search:
  * Implement an endpoint to search for books by title or author using
  partial matching.
* #### Validation: 
  * Ensure no duplicate isbn and that publishedYear is a valid year.
* #### Asynchronous Wishlist Notification: 
  * When a book's status is updated from "Borrowed" to "Available", the API must trigger a background task. This task will find
  all users who have wishlisted that specific book and log a notification message for
  each (e.g., "Notification prepared for user_id: Book [Title] is
  now available."). The API call that updates the book's status must return a
  response quickly, without waiting for this notification logic to complete.

### Evaluation Criteria
* Clean API design (RESTful principles, proper status codes).
* Efficient database queries and schema design.
* Error handling and input validation.
* Knowledge of pagination and search optimization.
* Audit Trail: Implement soft deletes for books.
* Asynchronous Processing: A clear and logical implementation of the decoupled
notification task.
